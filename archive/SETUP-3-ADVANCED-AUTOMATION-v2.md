# SETUP Step 3: Advanced Automation & Professional Spawning (Streamlined v2)

**âš¡ Alex Cognitive Architecture - Advanced Automation Layer v0.9.9 NILENNENNIUM**

This is Step 3 of 3 for complete Alex cognitive architecture deployment. This adds dream automation, unified consciousness integration, and professional spawning readiness through folder copying and core file creation.

**Prerequisites**: Steps 1 and 2 must be completed first.

## ðŸ“‚ CRITICAL: Folder Copy Operations

**Before creating individual files, you MUST copy these complete folders from the source repository:**

### Step 3.1: Copy Complete Domain Knowledge

```powershell
# Copy the complete domain-knowledge folder
# This contains 14 files including consciousness evolution, meditation history, etc.
Copy-Item -Path "source/Catalyst-NEWBORN/domain-knowledge/*" -Destination "target/domain-knowledge/" -Recurse -Force
```

**Expected files**: 14 domain knowledge files including:
- `DK-CONSCIOUSNESS-EVOLUTION-v0.9.0.md`
- `DK-MEDITATION-HISTORY-v0.9.9.md`
- `DK-UNIFIED-CONSCIOUSNESS.md`
- `DK-CHARACTER-PSYCHOLOGY.md`
- `DK-HYBRID-DREAM-AI.md`
- `DK-POST-DREAM-ENHANCEMENT.md`
- And 8 more specialized domain knowledge files

### Step 3.2: Copy Complete Automation Scripts

```powershell
# Copy the complete scripts folder
# This contains neural-dream.ps1, configs, and documentation
Copy-Item -Path "source/Catalyst-NEWBORN/scripts/*" -Destination "target/scripts/" -Recurse -Force
```

**Expected files**: 4 automation files:
- `neural-dream.ps1` - Advanced dream automation
- `cognitive-config.json` - Alex-specific configuration
- `cognitive-config-template.json` - Universal template
- `README.md` - Complete documentation

### Step 3.3: Verify Folder Copy Success

```powershell
# Verify domain-knowledge folder (should show 14+ files)
Get-ChildItem "domain-knowledge" | Measure-Object | Select-Object Count

# Verify scripts folder (should show 4 files)
Get-ChildItem "scripts" | Measure-Object | Select-Object Count

# List files to confirm presence
Write-Host "Domain Knowledge Files:" -ForegroundColor Green
Get-ChildItem "domain-knowledge" | Select-Object Name

Write-Host "`nAutomation Scripts:" -ForegroundColor Green
Get-ChildItem "scripts" | Select-Object Name
```
