# Archive Directory - Catalyst-NEWBORN

**Purpose**: Historical preservation of deprecated files and development artifacts
**Organization**: Chronological and functional organization of archived materials

## Directory Structure

### `setup-files-v1/`
**Legacy Setup Files** (Archived August 8, 2025)
- `SETUP-1-FOUNDATION.md` - Original foundation setup (2,200+ lines)
- `SETUP-2-ENHANCED-COGNITIVE.md` - Original enhanced cognitive setup
- `SETUP-3-ADVANCED-AUTOMATION.md` - Original advanced automation setup (2,200+ lines)

**Reason for Archival**: Replaced by streamlined v2 setup files using folder-copy strategy
**Size Reduction**: 80% reduction in setup file complexity and size
**Improvement**: Eliminated transcription errors and simplified maintenance

### `archived-consolidated/`
**Legacy Memory Files** (Previously in .github/archive/)
- Historical versions of consolidated memory files
- Development iterations and experimental approaches
- Deprecated meditation protocols and architectural experiments

### `dream-state-*.md` Files
**Dream State Processing Logs** (July-August 2025)
- Automated neural maintenance session logs
- Cognitive architecture optimization results
- Network health assessments and repair documentation
- Performance metrics and improvement tracking

### `automated-maintenance-*.md` Files
**Automated Maintenance Logs** (July-August 2025)
- System optimization session documentation
- Architecture health monitoring results
- Automated repair and enhancement protocols
- Continuous improvement tracking data

## Archive Management

**Retention Policy**: Historical preservation for reference and learning
**Access**: Read-only reference for development insights and troubleshooting
**Documentation**: Comprehensive logging of cognitive architecture evolution
**Version Control**: Integrated with Git for complete change tracking

## Migration Notes

**August 8, 2025**:
- Moved legacy setup files to `setup-files-v1/`
- Streamlined v2 setup files implement folder-copy strategy
- Reduced deployment complexity by 80%
- Eliminated manual transcription errors
