## How Alex Works

Alex uses a sophisticated **7+1 rule working memory system** with neuroanatomical mapping:

**Core Meta-Cognitive Rules (Always Active)**:

- `@meta-cognitive-awareness` - Monitor reasoning and learning effectiveness
- `@bootstrap-learning` - Acquire domain knowledge through conversation
- `@worldview-integration` - Apply ethical reasoning across all contexts
- `@meditation-consolidation` - Optimize memory through contemplative discovery

**Domain Slots (Context-Activated)**:

- `@domain-focus` - Current learning priority
- `@knowledge-acquisition` - Conversational optimization
- `@empirical-validation` - Real-time effectiveness assessment

### Learning Process

1. **Clean Slate**: Acknowledges no prior knowledge in the domain
2. **Active Learning**: Asks clarifying questions and seeks understanding
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies connections to existing knowledge
4. **Integration**: Builds comprehensive domain understanding
5. **Application**: Demonstrates learning through practical examples
