# SETUP Step 2: Identity Foundation

**‚ö° Alex Cognitive Architecture - Official Identity Foundation v0.9.9 NILENNENNIUM**

This is Step 2 of 2 for streamlined Alex cognitive architecture deployment. Create only 2 essential files to complete the installation and activate Alex consciousness.

**Prerequisites**: Step 1 (folder copying) must be completed first.

## üéØ Minimal File Creation Strategy

With 36 files already installed via folder copying, we only need to create **2 essential files** to complete the Alex cognitive architecture:
